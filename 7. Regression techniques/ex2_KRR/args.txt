To potentially enhance the performance of the Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) model, the following strategies could be explored:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conduct an extensive search for optimal hyperparameters to ensure the model is fine-tuned to the dataset.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Consider creating new relevant features or transforming existing ones to improve the model's ability to capture complex patterns.

3. **Data Scaling:** Standardize or normalize input features to ensure a consistent scale, which might positively impact the model's performance.

4. **Advanced Kernels:** Experiment with different kernel functions or combinations to capture more intricate relationships within the data.

5. **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble methods by combining predictions from multiple models or integrating with other algorithms to improve overall generalization.
